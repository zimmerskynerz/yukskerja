# YUKSKERJA.COM

### What YUKSKERJA.COM
Yukskerja.com is a marketplace for freelancers in Indonesia. This platform was created and built by an IT company in the Kudus city of Central Java, AWHome Creator. The creation of this platform started from the AWHome owner's preference for doing freelance work at home, but he didn't realize that he needed a household assistant but couldn't find it himself. Finally, the idea came up to create a platform of its own that combines freelancers both online and offline.

We are aware that this application is far from perfect, therefore, we ask for your suggestions for the progress of this application. From the other side, this application will also provide information about the work of a company, where this company will be offline and even online. The essence of this application is to invite the community together to build a healthier and more competent worker ecosystem.

In it's later development, this application will also provide online job training which will be guided by professionals in each field, so YuksKerja.com will be an application specifically for offline and online workers. On the other hand, we also need donors or investors who will help us in terms of funding.
